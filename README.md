Unlocking insights to foster equitable workplaces using **Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing workforce **diversity and inclusion** to identify gaps and provide actionable, data-driven recommendations for creating fair and equitable workplaces.

### Objectives
- **Workforce Analysis**: Assess current diversity and inclusion metrics.  
- **Identify Gaps**: Detect disparities in hiring, promotion, turnover, and performance.  
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Offer strategic improvements to HR practices.

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses & Insights

### Excel
- Handled missing values (imputation/removal).  
- Removed duplicate records.  
- Standardized categorical fields (e.g., gender values: `M â†’ Male`, `F â†’ Female`).  

### SQL
- **Promotions by Gender**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Gender, COUNT(Employee_ID) AS No_of_Employees
  FROM Promotion
  GROUP BY Gender;
  ```

- **Performance Rating Trends by Job Level**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Job_Level_after_FY20_promotions AS Job_Level,
         CONCAT(ROUND(AVG(FY19_Performance_Rating), 2), '%') AS Avg_FY19_Performance,
         CONCAT(ROUND(AVG(FY20_Performance_Rating), 2), '%') AS Avg_FY20_Performance,
         CONCAT(ROUND(AVG(FY20_Performance_Rating) - AVG(FY19_Performance_Rating), 2), '%') AS Rating_Change
  FROM Promotion
  GROUP BY Job_Level_after_FY20_promotions
  ORDER BY Job_Level_after_FY20_promotions;
  ```

- **Employee Distribution by Performance Rating (FY20)**:
  ```sql
  SELECT FY20_Performance_Rating,
         COUNT(Employee_ID) AS Employee
  FROM Promotion
  GROUP BY FY20_Performance_Rating
  ORDER BY FY20_Performance_Rating;
  ```
  ðŸ”Ž Insight: Equal number of employees (19 each) received performance ratings **1** and **4**.  

### Python
- **Gender Distribution**: Count plots of employees by gender.  
- **Employees by Department & Gender**: Visualization of departmental diversity.  

### Promotion Trends (2011â€“2020)
- ðŸ“‰ **Decline (2011â€“2014)**: Drop from 47 to 27 promotions.  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Growth (2015â€“2017)**: Peak at 90 promotions in 2017.  
- ðŸ“‰ **Sharp Decline (2018â€“2019)**: Down to 33 promotions.  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Recovery (2020)**: Rise to 66 promotions.
